This file describes how to run the Python files and bash scripts used in this project.

All Python files can be run as standalone programs using a standard Python interpreter but we used version 2.7.  When running the Python programs, use -a to specify the agg/batch size, -n to specify the number of records, and -r to specify the number of records. The bash scripts should also be able to be run by simply issuing a bash command but the parameters of the python programs will need changed depending on the run. For all Python programs, the configuration settings for streams, users, and permissions will need to be altered to match your settings.
